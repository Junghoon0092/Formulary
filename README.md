# Formulary

Formulary is a new library for creating dynamic, declarative, table view forms for iOS.

There's no lack of declarative TableView form libraries for iOS. 
                   
Formulary is inspired by XLForm, written in Swift, and designed for developer flexibility.
It is intended to stay small and possibly as a foundation for ther libraries.

Development-oriented features include:s

* Form components are Swift protocols
* Lots of points of control to override default behavior
* Easy to integrate with existing model classes

Other cool features:

* "Floating Labels" for form fields.
